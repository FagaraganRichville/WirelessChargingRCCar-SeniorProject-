# WirelessChargingRCCar-SeniorProject-
A College Senior Project focusing on Fabricating a Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) System for an Remote-Control Car. Note: Currently being updated 

**Purpose**

The purpose of this project is 
1. Figure out how Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) operates
2. Build several components of WPT system such as High-Frequency AC Inverter and Rectifier Circuit and fabricate them on a PCB
3. Try charging an Remote-Control (RC) Car Battery using WPT

The RC Car that is used is the Elegoo Smart Robot Car V4.0

**GitHub Repository Tree**

I will provide the PCB Design of the DC-DC Converter, H-Bridge Driver (original design made by GreatScott with modifications by me to include Bypass Filter Capacitors of 100 microfarad), the Full-Bridge Diode Rectifier Circuit, and the Power Management IC BQ2594 that wss used. It is located under PCB folder 

I will also include my report in addition to some of the design steps.
